***COMP 20 Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side***
By: Sophie Loman
Date: 4/26/16

I wrote a report assessing the security and privacy vulnerabilities in Danny Garfield's Assignment 3 code. Four main vulnerabilities are discussed, and screenshots are provided to aid in a description of each threat. I spent about 2 hours on this assignment, and referenced Gabe Joseph's report as an example of how to format my report. I also spoke with Derek Benson about cross-site scripting.
