I updated an HTML file using JavaScript and jQuery in order to log text typed into an input box in the space below with the latest update showing first. Each input is logged upon the release of the 'Enter' key and is preceded by a time stamp. I also updated the HTML in order to declare a charset. I did not discuss this assignment with anyone and worked on it for about an hour and a half.
