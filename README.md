***COMP 20 Lab 9: Finalizing My Learning Portfolio***

(1) Purpose of this Git repository

	The function of this Git repository is to exist as a demonstration of the work I have done in
	this course, which will be useful for future endeavors (reference for other projects, potential
	employers, etc.)

(2) Favorite lab or assignment

	Though my first stab at this assignment was rushed and underdeveloped due to outside
	circumstances, my favorite assignment was definitely Assignment 3. For one thing, it was
	exciting to remove the veil of mystery that seemed to cover the server-side code while working
	on Assignment 2; Assignment 3 allowed us to create something that didn't rely on any existing
	structure (which is sometimes an anomoly in introductory computer science
	courses.)Addiitionally, I felt like I never really understood the components of an HTTP request
	until working to merge client-side code and server-side code into a cohesive product. Finally,
	it really emphasized the importance of attention to detail for me. I went back after receiving
	feedback on my assignment and went through the code again, paying closer attention to the
	details, and was able to fix my initial mistakes; I believe this was a very valuable experience
	for me.

(3) Growth in COMP 20

	I think I've learned to be much more autonomous in my programming over the course of this
	semester. Most of the assignments in COMP 20 rely on outside research, which helped me to become
	more comfortable with encountering a large, seemingly impenetrable problem and finding the right
	resources to break the problem down and come to an understanding.

(4) Most important thing I learned

	One of the most important things I've learned in this course is that to be creative in
	programming, one must first have strong technical knowledge and understanding. While working on
	both Assignment 4 and the semester group project, I found that in order to formulate a creative
	idea of what I wanted to do, I first had to fully understand what was possible. A fundamental
	understanding of concepts such as the XMLHttpRequest object or query strings allowed me to
	better experiment and formulate questions, providing an avenue for creativity.

(5) Future curiosities

	I feel excited and curious to learn more about a couple very diverse concepts; specifically, I
	would like to learn more about intelligent web design and exactly how to build this myself.
	Additonally, I would like to learn how to handle more complex data in general, both in web
	programming and otherwise.
