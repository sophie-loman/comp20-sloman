***COMP 20 Lab 4: Responsive Design***
By: Sophie Loman
Date: 2/14/16

I created a webpage that illustrates the principle of responsive design by displaying different frames of a 10-frame comic depending on the width of the client's browser screen. I implemented this design by using multiple media queries, each of which defined different positions for a background indicated in a single class. I worked alone and spent about 2 hours on this project.
