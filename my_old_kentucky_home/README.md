This is a webpage containing a video of the Kentucky state song, captioned by the lyrics to the song. The captions update at every line, and contain a few images. Everything seems to be implemented correctly, though the images tend to take a moment to load, and the alternate text flashes during this time. I spent about 2.5 hours on this assignment and did not collaborate with anyone.
